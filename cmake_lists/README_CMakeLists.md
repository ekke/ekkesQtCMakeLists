Disclaimer:
ekke started with no knowledge about CMake, also dealing with build systems isn't ekke's domain. If there's something wrong or can be done better/easier, please let ekke know about. (@ekke [Qt Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ykrgHtFGTA))

Limitations:
ekke’s CMakeLists.txt is specialized for mobile apps and projects with nested subfolders (QML, Resources) – typically QMake projects ported from Qt 5.15. See [ekke's Project Structure](https://t1p.de/ekkesProjectStructure).
For non-mobile QML apps take a look at Qt docs: [Building a QML Application](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-build-qml-application.html)
